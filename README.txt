To run the program just run 'make' to utilize the included makefile, then type "main.x <filename>" where filename is the 
file of the graph you want to check. The only dependency is that the largest node must not have a value that is greater 
than the vertex count for that graph. This is not a problem for the Stanford or Notre Dame graph.
